# MPU6050_LIBRARY

The original library for the MPU6050 only allows you to read the sensor data with the default settings - This library allows you to change the sensitivity of the sensor as well as set it into sleep mode.

The sensitivity options are:

	GYRO_RANGE_250DS  (250 degrees / second)
	GYRO_RANGE_500DS  (500 degrees / second)
	GYRO_RANGE_1000DS (1000 degrees / second)
	GYRO_RANGE_2000DS (5000 degrees / second)

	ACCEL_RANGE_2G  (2gs)
	ACCEL_RANGE_4G  (4gs)
	ACCEL_RANGE_8G  (8gs)
	ACCEL_RANGE_16G (16gs)

The example is meant for beginners and gives in depth details on how to set up the code. Look there for further setup info.
